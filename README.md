### Exemptions		
The company is allowed to select more than one exemption.

#### [Reg D](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-regdhtm.html)
Provides exemptions for small companies to issue equity or debt. Reg D provides the exemption only for the transaction in which the security is sold.
[Form D](https://www.sec.gov/about/forms/formd.pdf) must be filed with SEC before or within 15 calendar days of the first sale of the security. The form also has to be filed with each state in which purchasers of the securities reside (if the state requires it.)
  
There are sections within Reg D that specify different offering choices:
* [Rule 504](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-rule504.html) (MAX $5M)  
  Securities offered under Rule 504 are “restricted securities” and cannot be sold for at least 6 months or a year without registering them.
* [Rule 506](https://www.sec.gov/fast-answers/answers-rule506htm.html): (Max $ unlimited)

    *  The company cannot use general solicitation or advertising to market the securities.

            - Tell investors how to access the offering cicular.
            - Have SEC "qualify" the offering statement. _SEC qualifciation is not the same thing as SEC approval. The SEC also does not assess the accuracy or completeness of any of the offering documents or solicitation materials._
            * __Tier 1__ : $20M max in any 12-month period, including no more than $6M on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer. 
                * SEC has to qualify the offering.
                * _Reporting Req:_ Not have ongoing reporting requirements other than a final report on [Form 1-Z](https://www.sec.gov/files/form1-z.pdf) on the status of the offering.   
            * __Tier 2__: $50M max in 12-month period, including no more than $15M on behalf of selling securityholders that are affiliates of the issuer.
